/**
 * @file glx_static.c
 *
 * Simple touch-test of using epoxy when linked statically.  On Linux,
 * the ifunc support we'd like to use has some significant behavior
 * changes depending on whether it's a static build or shared library
 * build.
 *
 * Note that if configured without --enable-static, this test will end
 * up dynamically linked anyway, defeating the test.
